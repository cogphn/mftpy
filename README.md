# mftpy
Parse Master File Table (MFT) records using Python

## About
This code was written for the 2011 DC3 challenge. It was originally written using Python2.7. That code is still available in the mft.2.7 directory.

It has since been updated to Python3 in the mft directory.

**This code is no longer under active development**
